<p align="justify">InclusivePalette is a Python script that generates random colors adapted for color-blindness. It uses the HSV color space to generate a variety of distinct colors and applies a transformation algorithm to adjust the colors for different types of color-blindness - protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. With InclusivePalette, you can create accessible and visually appealing scientific illustrations and data visualizations.<br><br>
This script doesn't require any external libraries and is easy to use. You can simply call the function and pass an optional seed value to generate a different set of colors each time. The output is a list of hexadecimal color codes that you can use in your Python code or other applications.<br><br>
If you're looking for a tool to make your scientific graphics more inclusive, give InclusivePalette a try!</p>
